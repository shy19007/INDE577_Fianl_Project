# INDE 577 - Shaoyu Yan - Final Project - Data Science & Machine Learning

**Instructor**: Randy R. Davila

## Course Description

Welcome to the capstone project repository for INDE 577 - Data Science and Machine Learning, led by Randy R. Davila. This course has traversed through an extensive array of data science and machine learning topics, spanning supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning domains. Throughout this journey, we've engaged in hands-on applications, honed our Python programming skills, and embraced various data science methodologies.

## Repository Layout

Our repository is structured to provide a comprehensive exploration of machine learning applications, divided into four pivotal sections, each replete with in-depth implementations and insightful analysis:

### Supervised Learning

This segment showcases our endeavors with various supervised learning techniques:

- **Perceptron**: Our gateway to linear classification models.
- **Logistic Regression**: Employed for binary and multiclass classification challenges.
- **Neural Network (MLP)**: Diving deep with multi-layer perceptrons.
- **Decision/Regression Trees**: Navigating classification and regression via tree-based models.
- **Ensemble Learning**: Leveraging the collective strength of methods like Random Forest.
- **k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**: The quintessence of non-parametric classification.

### Unsupervised Learning

Here, we unravel the nuances of unsupervised learning methodologies:

- **k-Means Clustering**: Grouping data points with this clustering classic.
- **DBSCAN**: Tackling spatial clustering challenges in data with noise.
- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**: Reducing dimensionality to enhance feature understanding.

### Reinforcement Learning

Within this section, we embark on an exploration of reinforcement learning basics:

- **Tabular Reinforcement Learning**: An introductory dive into the fundamentals of reinforcement learning.

### Datasets

The datasets folder contains various datasets used in our implementations:
