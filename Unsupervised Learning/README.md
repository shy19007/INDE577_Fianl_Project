# **Unsupervised Learning Project Summaries for INDE 577**

In the Unsupervised Learning section of our capstone project for INDE 577 - Data Science and Machine Learning, we explore complex data sets through the lens of unsupervised algorithms to uncover intrinsic patterns and groupings without pre-labeled outcomes. Below are the summaries of three comprehensive projects that demonstrate the application and impact of unsupervised learning techniques in various domains:

## **Comprehensive Guide to k-Means Clustering on Credit Card Customer Data:**

- Focus: Segmentation of credit card customers using k-Means clustering to reveal patterns in customer behavior and preferences.

- Implementation: This project involves a detailed exploratory data analysis followed by the application of the k-Means clustering algorithm. Techniques like the Elbow Method and Silhouette Analysis help determine the optimal number of clusters.

- Outcome: The k-Means clustering effectively segments customers into distinct groups, providing actionable insights for targeted marketing and personalized service offerings, thereby enhancing customer engagement strategies.

## **Global Refugee Trends Analysis with DBSCAN Clustering:**

- Focus: Analysis of global refugee movements using the DBSCAN algorithm to identify trends and outliers in the data from 1951 to 2015.

- Implementation: DBSCAN is applied to model the complexity of refugee movements, with its ability to handle noise and identify clusters of varying shapes and sizes proving critical for this application.

- Outcome: The project uncovers significant patterns corresponding to historical events, offering a nuanced view of refugee trends over time. The flexibility of DBSCAN in cluster formation and outlier detection makes it particularly suited to socio-political datasets like refugee movements.

## **Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on the Fake Bills Dataset:**

- Focus: Application of PCA to reduce dimensionality in the Fake Bills dataset, aiming to distinguish between genuine and counterfeit banknotes.

- Implementation: The PCA process involves standardizing the data, calculating the covariance matrix, and then extracting the principal components that capture the most variance.

- Outcome: PCA successfully identifies key features that differentiate genuine bills from counterfeits, facilitating easier visualization and analysis of complex data sets. This approach not only aids in forensic analysis but also supports quality control and data exploration.

These projects collectively illustrate the power of unsupervised learning in extracting value from unstructured or unlabeled data, addressing challenges across financial and humanitarian sectors. Each project not only deepens the understanding of specific algorithms but also provides insights into their practical applications, paving the way for future innovations in data-driven decision-making.
