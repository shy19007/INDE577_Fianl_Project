# INDE 577 - Shaoyu Yan - Data Science & Machine Learning

**Instructor**: Randy R. Davila

## Course Description

Welcome to the capstone project repository for INDE 577 - Data Science and Machine Learning, led by Randy R. Davila. This course has traversed through an extensive array of data science and machine learning topics, spanning supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning domains. Throughout this journey, we've engaged in hands-on applications, honed our Python programming skills, and embraced various data science methodologies.

## Repository Layout

Our repository is structured to provide a comprehensive exploration of machine learning applications, divided into four pivotal sections, each replete with in-depth implementations and insightful analysis:

### Supervised Learning

This segment showcases our endeavors with various supervised learning techniques:

- **Perceptron**: Our gateway to linear classification models.
- **Logistic Regression**: Employed for binary and multiclass classification challenges.
- **Neural Network (MLP)**: Diving deep with multi-layer perceptrons.
- **Decision/Regression Trees**: Navigating classification and regression via tree-based models.
- **Ensemble Learning**: Leveraging the collective strength of methods like Random Forest.
- **k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**: The quintessence of non-parametric classification.

### Unsupervised Learning

Here, we unravel the nuances of unsupervised learning methodologies:

- **k-Means Clustering**: Grouping data points with this clustering classic.
- **DBSCAN**: Tackling spatial clustering challenges in data with noise.
- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**: Reducing dimensionality to enhance feature understanding.

### Reinforcement Learning

Within this section, we embark on an exploration of reinforcement learning basics:

- **Tabular Reinforcement Learning**: An introductory dive into the fundamentals of reinforcement learning.

### Datasets

The datasets folder contains various datasets used in our implementations:

- **COVID-19 Symptoms:** This dataset captures an array of symptoms and demographic details aimed at predicting COVID-19 infection statuses.

- **Cancer Data:** A collection of attributes used to assess cancer risk or detect its presence.

- **Credit Card Customer Data:** Insights into customer profiles, vital for evaluating creditworthiness or designing financial products.

- **Diabetes:** Medical records catering to the study of diabetes, facilitating the development of predictive models for diagnosis or progression of the disease.

- **Fake Bills:** Features designed to distinguish genuine banknotes from counterfeit ones.

- **MNIST Test:** The benchmark dataset for testing machine learning models on the task of handwritten digit recognition.

- **Penguins:** Ecological data related to penguin species, useful in biodiversity research and ecological modeling.

- **Raw Data (COVID-19 Symptoms):** The preliminary dataset concerning COVID-19 symptoms, serving as a substrate for cleaning and detailed analysis.

## Repository Navigation

To delve into our projects, simply navigate to the designated folders for supervised learning, unsupervised learning, reinforcement learning, and datasets. Within each folder, you'll find comprehensive README.md files and Jupyter notebooks that bring our implementations to life.

We extend our gratitude for your interest in our capstone project repository. It's our hope that you'll find the presented implementations and analyses both enlightening and meticulously organized.
